{"name":"TMSU","tagline":"TMSU lets you tags your files and then access them through a nifty virtual filesystem from any other application.","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nTMSU is a tool for tagging your files. It provides a simple command-line tool for applying tags and a virtual filesystem so that you can get a tag-based view of your files from within any other program.\r\n\r\nTMSU does not alter your files in any way: they remain unchanged on disk, or on the network, wherever you put them. TMSU maintains its own database and you simply gain an additional view, which you can mount, based upon the tags you set up. The only commitment required is your time and there's absolutely no lock-in.\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\nSee the [quick tour](http://tmsu.org/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
